This program reads the dir it is in, fetches the file names and writes them to a .txt.

Process: 
1. Walk through path in folder files one by one as [ ]byte data
2. Ask for pass phrase 
3. Encrypt pass phrase to 32 byte slice with sha256 checksum
4. Encrypt data with AES and GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) as operation mode
5. Add sha256 checksum of file to the additional data of aes GCM ciphertext

To-Do:
- 3 Functions to choose from: Encrypt, Decrypt, Compare
- Compare function to new file
- File reader to new file + move into package
- Documentation
- Manual
- Error log
- Session log

Notes: 
- File name needs to be passed to aditional data if necessary



# Manual:

1. Copy the the executalbe and the folder "files" in to a separate folder.
2. Copy some files or any kind of data into the folder "files". Make sure that you only use copies of the files/data. Since this is a test there is no guaranty that you data takes no damage.
3. After several runs with different files/data check if the data in the folder "decrypted" has taken any damage.
4. Please sent the files in the folder "logs" 

!!!Thank you for the participation in this test!!!
